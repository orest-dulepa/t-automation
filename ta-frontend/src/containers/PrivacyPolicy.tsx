          with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you take such as which
          features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports
          (sometimes called &apos;crash dumps&apos;) and hardware settings).

          device&apos;s location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we
          collect depends on the type of settings of the device you use to access the Website. For
          example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us
          your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to
          collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your

      </ul>

      <h2 id="transferred">4. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h2>

      <p>
        <i>
          <b>In Short:</b> We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other
          than your own.
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>
        Our servers are located in. If you are accessing our Website from outside, please be aware
        that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities
        and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see &quot;

        </Anchor>
        &quot; above), in and other countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not
        necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in
        your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal
        information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2 id="keep">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

      <p>
        <i>
          <b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
          outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.

      </p>

      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes
        set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
        law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than 2 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we
        will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example,
        because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely
        store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
        possible.
      </p>

      <h2 id="keep-safe">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

      <p>
        <i>

          organizational and technical security measures.
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to
        protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards
        and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
        information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
        guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able
        to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
        Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website
        within a secure environment.

          <b>In Short:</b> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18
          years of age.
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using
        the Website, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian
        of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Website. If we learn that
        personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will
        deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our
        records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18,
        please contact us at support@ta.com.

      <h2 id="features">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
        Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
        not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
        stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
        finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
        mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
        standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
        you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
